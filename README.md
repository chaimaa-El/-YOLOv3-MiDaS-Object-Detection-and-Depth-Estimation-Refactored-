# YOLOv3-MiDaS-Object-Detection-and-Depth-Estimation-Refactored-
This repository contains a refactored version of the original sarvan0506/yolo-midas project, which combines YOLOv3 for object detection with MiDaS for monocular depth estimation. The refactor organizes the code into a more maintainable structure with clearer documentation.
